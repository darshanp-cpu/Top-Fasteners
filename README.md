# Top Fasteners Website

Optimized industrial website for Top Fasteners, built with pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Source code (Edit files here)
  - `pages/`: HTML files (`index.html`, `products.html`, `about.html`)
  - `css/`: Stylesheets
  - `js/`: JavaScript logic
  - `assets/`: Images and animation frames
- **`dist/`**: Production build (Generated by `npm run build`)
- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts (`build.js`, `convert_frames.js`)

## 🛠️ Development

To run the site locally:

```bash
npm start
```

This starts a local server at `http://localhost:8080`.
Navigate to **`src/pages/index.html`** to view the site.

> **Note**: HTML files use `../` relative paths to access CSS/JS in development. The build script automatically flattens these for production.

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages
Detailed automatic deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
This runs the build script and pushes the `dist/` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Vercel
1. Connect this repository to Vercel.
2. Vercel will detect `package.json` and run `npm run build`.
3. **Settings**: Ensure "Output Directory" is set to `dist` (if not auto-detected).

## ⚡ Performance Features
- **WebP Animation**: Hero frames converted to WebP for 70% size reduction.
- **Smart Preloading**: `hero.js` prioritizes initial frames.
- **Optimized CSS**: Uses `content-visibility` and GPU acceleration.
